							<h1>Guessing Game</h1>
							<p>This was an individual project where we were told to create a website where you could login, play a guessing game, and stores the data to a database. I have created websites with HTML/CSS/Javascript before but this was my first time using PHP, databases, and hosting services on a website.</p>
							<p>When logging in or creating an account the username, hashedpassword and sait is stored on a locally hosted MySQL database. To salt and hash the passwords I used this code:</p>
<pre>
$salt = random_bytes(16);
$saltedPass = $password . $salt;
$hashedPass = hash('sha256', $saltedPass);
</pre>
							<p>As part of the assignment we were not allowed to use the existing hashing functions such as password_hash(). For the actual game it generates a random number between 1 and 100 and tells the user if they are too low/high. Once a game is complete their number of guesses are saved to the database and the top ten scores are shown.</p>
							<p>A challenge I faced while creating this website was that I have never worked with PHP or MySql before. We had a few lectures on both topic but I had to research most of it. The biggest hurdle I had to over come was connecting to my database. I recently started to get into raspberry pis and I wanted to use one for the database in this project. The actual installation of the database was fairly easy. The tricky part was port forwarding so that I could access the database outside of my local network. Once I did that I added a connection file to the project and was able to read/write to the database.</p>
							<p>The tool I used for this project includes PHPStorm, MySql, InfinityFree, Ubuntu, DataGrip, and Bootstrap</p>
